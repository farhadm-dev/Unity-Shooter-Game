# UnityGame_Shooter
A mobile 2D shooter game, reminiscent of Stickman Sniper and Clear Vision, developed using the Unity3D engine.

The game's story is about neighbors in an alley, and for each level, one of the neighbors made a mistake, and you should punish them with your customized blowgun.

Wind direction and speed, remaining time & number of bullets are three things that increase the challenges of the game levels.
